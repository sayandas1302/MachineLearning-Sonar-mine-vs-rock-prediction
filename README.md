# MachineLearning-Sonar-mine-vs-rock-prediction
Submarines use to sonar signals to send under the water and recieves it when it reflects back to detect some object under the water. Based on this sonar signal it determines the presence of some object under the sea. We are given with this sonar recieve dataset. Our target is to build a model based on the data to determine whether some object detected by the submarine is a rock or or a mine.

### Getting started
1. Download the entire project folder and create an environment inside the folder
2. Next in the cmd prompt activate the created environment and use the commandline 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to install all the required module in the environment
3. run files
