# MachineLearning-Sonar-mine-vs-rock-prediction
Submarines use to sonar signals to send under the water and recieves it when it reflects back to detect some object under the water. Based on this sonar signal it determines the presence of some object under the sea. We are given with this sonar recieve dataset. Our target is to build a model based on the data to determine whether some object detected by the submarine is a rock or or a mine.
